There are many more things that it will be appropriate to study about limits in due time. For instance we have not gotten to a serious discussion of series, which are sequences defined so that each $n$'th element is a sum of the first $n$ elements of some other series. Later in the chapter we will also discuss limits of sequences in higher dimensions or on abstract spaces. But studying limits on series is in many ways similar to studying limits on sequences, only with the additional structure that a series is defined by some other sequence which may have its own noteworthy properties. And limits of sequences in higher dimensions or abstract spaces, while a huge topic which we will spend much time on, will ultimately become a meditation moreso on the properties of spaces than a wholly new way that we think about limits.

In that way at least, this section may be considered the apex of our discussion of limits. Here we move from limits on sequences, which we had previously discussed as standing in for \squote{paths}, and we move to studying limits on the paths themselves. Or rather, we will finally study limits on functions. These are exactly the limits that will make possible almost all discussion of derivatives in various forms of calculus, and many of our notions of integrals.

We require a reframing though. When we studied sequences, we studied a path that is counted, and we considered a notion of infinity in \dquote{what happens to this sequence when we count on forever?} i.e. we put our infinity, the infinity in $\lim_{n\to\infty}$ at the end of the counting numbers. What a notion of limits on \emph{functions} will allow us to do is to study what happens when a function goes \emph{infinitely close} to a point. It will become possible to ask in some cases \dquote{what is a function $f$ at point $p$ for which $p$ is not a valid input?}
