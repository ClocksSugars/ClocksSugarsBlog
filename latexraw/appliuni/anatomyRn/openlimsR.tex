In this section it is pertinant to stop and examine the properties of real numbers again, as it turns out that the axiom of completeness has much more significant consequences than its mere statement might suggest. That is, we have mentioned many times in the previous section the notion of a \squote{region of convergence}, and while we have formally discussed the idea of \squote{convergence}, we have not yet formally discussed the notion of a \squote{region}.

Such a concept is deceptively complicated, as it cuts to the heart of what separates the discrete regime of numbers from continuous mathematics, and more importantly, is at the heart of why it is meaningful for us to speak of numbers as a model for geometry at all. The real numbers are constructed with the intention that they have \emph{no gaps}. In mathematics, we speak about this property positively and instead say that \dquote{the real numbers are \textbf{complete}}. There are multiple criteria for completeness (which in certain hairsplitting settings even disagree quite badly) but for the purposes of real analysis we are generally concerned with \emph{Cauchy completeness}.
